#### Your Terminal environment

In this directory, we have a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based website along with a Dockerfile, which will be used to build a container image for this application.

```terminal:execute
command: cd ~/intro && ls
```

#### Docker and Kubernetes App Buttons

The two buttons _Docker App_ and _Kubernetes App_ will display your website once it is up and running.
